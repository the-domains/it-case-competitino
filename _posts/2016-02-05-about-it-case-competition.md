# About IT Case Competition

## What?

A Nationwide Case Competition evolving around the subjects of IT and Business. The purpose is to enable every IT student to get together and test their abilities against a real world IT/Business case. The case will be revealed when the competition begins.

## Why?

Case Competitions across the world have been experiencing increased interest within the last years. As the demand for IT and Innovation continues to grow, we deem it necessary to create a platform that enables students to use their knowledge to solve a case that includes not only business but also IT.

## When?

The competition will last for three days and is held from March 12 to March 14, 2015\. The event will end with a grand finale Galla event, so remember to bring your finest suit or dress!

## Where?

The location will be announced as soon as everything is in place, but will be held within the Copenhagen area.
